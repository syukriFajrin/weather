# Build K-nearst Model
---
## Overview
---
This project aims to predict weather based on their variabels using a K-nearst  model.

---
## Objectives
---
* Perform data scaling  
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Build a Linear Regression model  
* Provide insights based on the results  

---
## Dataset
---
The dataset contains 1 feature and 1 target variable:
* temp_c 
* dew_point_temp_c
* rel_hum_%
* wind_speed_km/h
* visibility_km
* press_kpa
* time
* months
* year
* weathers (target)
